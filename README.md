## Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and Infertility in U.S. Women: A Population-Based Study from NHANES 2017- March 2020 
## Overview
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a preventable reproductive infection that can lead to long-term complications, including infertility. This project uses nationally representative NHANES 2017–2020 data from U.S. women aged 18–59 years to examine whether a history of PID is associated with increased odds of infertility after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors. Survey-weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression are used to estimate prevalence and adjusted associations. This repository documents my MPH Epidemiology Practicum Capstone and provides population-level evidence to support early STI detection, timely treatment, and improved reproductive healthcare access.

## Background Information
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a preventable reproductive health condition that can lead to serious long-term outcomes, including tubal factor infertility. Although previous research has demonstrated a biological link between PID and infertility, population-based evidence using recent nationally representative data remains limited. This study examined the association between self-reported PID history and infertility among U.S. women aged 18–59 years using NHANES 2017–2020 data.

## Methods: 
This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 2,813 U.S. women who completed the reproductive health questionnaire. Infertility was defined as reporting ≥12 months attempting to become pregnant without success. The exposure, PID history, was based on self-report of ever being told by a healthcare professional that they had PID. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (AORs), controlling age, race/ethnicity, income-to-poverty ratio, health insurance status, and usual source of care.

## Results:
Among 2,813 U.S. women aged 18–59 years, 178 (6.33%) reported a lifetime history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Overall, 6.33% of the sample reported infertility (n = 178), defined as ≥12 months attempting pregnancy without success. Infertility prevalence was higher among women with a history of PID 9.88% (n = 33) compared with those without PID 5.35% (n = 145). Women with PID had nearly twice the odds of infertility (unadjusted OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.34–2.98) compared with women without a history of PID. This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors (fully adjusted AOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.13–3.18). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses using unweighted logistic regression, supporting the robustness of the findings.

## Conclusion: 
A history of PID was significantly associated with increased odds of infertility among U.S. women, even after adjusting for socioeconomic and healthcare related variables. These findings reinforce the importance of early STI detection, timely PID treatment, and improved access to reproductive healthcare to prevent long-term fertility complications. Public health efforts should prioritize PID prevention and equitable access to care to reduce the burden of preventable infertility.
