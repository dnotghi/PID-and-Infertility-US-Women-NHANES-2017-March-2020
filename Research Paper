Abstract
Background: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a preventable reproductive health condition that can lead to serious long-term outcomes, including tubal factor infertility. Although previous research has demonstrated a biological link between PID and infertility, population-based evidence using recent nationally representative data remains limited. This study examined the association between self-reported PID history and infertility among U.S. women aged 18–59 years using NHANES 2017–2020 data.
Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 2,813 U.S. women who completed the reproductive health questionnaire. Infertility was defined as reporting ≥12 months attempting to become pregnant without success. The exposure, PID history, was based on self-report of ever being told by a healthcare professional that they had PID. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (AORs), controlling age, race/ethnicity, income-to-poverty ratio, health insurance status, and usual source of care.
Results: Among 2,813 U.S. women aged 18–59 years, 178 (6.33%) reported a lifetime history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Overall, 6.33% of the sample reported infertility (n = 178), defined as ≥12 months attempting pregnancy without success. Infertility prevalence was higher among women with a history of PID 9.88% (n = 33) compared with those without PID 5.35% (n = 145). Women with PID had nearly twice the odds of infertility (unadjusted OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.34–2.98) compared with women without a history of PID. This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors (fully adjusted AOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.13–3.18). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses using unweighted logistic regression, supporting the robustness of the findings.
Conclusion: A history of PID was significantly associated with increased odds of infertility among U.S. women, even after adjusting for socioeconomic and healthcare-related variables. These findings reinforce the importance of early STI detection, timely PID treatment, and improved access to reproductive healthcare to prevent long-term fertility complications. Public health efforts should prioritize PID prevention and equitable access to care to reduce the burden of preventable infertility.
Background
Each year more than 1 million females in the United States are diagnosed with Pelvic Inflammatory disease (PID), while more than 100,000 individuals become infertile due to this disease1.  PID is an infection of one or more of the upper genital organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) caused by unprotected sex and which can result in significant reproductive consequences to women2. This disease often occurs when sexually transmitted bacteria spread from a woman’s vagina to her reproductive organs 1. There are various sources of bacteria that can cause PID such as Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis, however the two most common sexually transmitted infections are gonorrhea and chlamydia; which cause about 90% of all PID cases1. Less commonly, PID can also occur when normal bacteria get into a woman’s reproductive organs after childbirth, pelvic surgery, miscarriage, or through an intrauterine device (IUD) 1. There is no single laboratory test to diagnose PID, which leaves providers with the strenuous task of determining the diagnosis based on a woman’s medical history, a pelvic exam, or a vaginal culture to test discharge for certain bacteria 2. To treat and cure PID, a provider will prescribe oral antibiotics by mouth to consume for 14 days, however if this disease goes untreated or if woman experiences repeat infections; then this may result in a high probability of infertility. Given the high incidence, diagnostic challenges, and potential for irreversible reproductive harm, evaluating the burden of infertility among women with a history of PID should be a public health priority.
Infertility
According to statistics, approximately 15-20% of women develop infertility after being diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia or gonorrhea 3. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive a child within a 12-month period or greater of regular unprotected intercourse3. According to 2025 CDC data, 8.5% of married women ages 15-49 in the U.S. have been diagnosed with infertility, while 12.2% of women have used infertility services in their lives4. The most common type of infertility that is associated with PID is known as tubal factor infertility, which occurs when there is a blockage in the fallopian tubes that will not allow the egg and sperm to meet due to diseases such as PID caused by STDs like chlamydia and gonnorhea5. Since PID is often asymptomatic, many women go undiagnosed resulting in increased rates of undiagnosed tubal infertility and ultimately causing women to not be able to have children6. The most reliable method for diagnosing PID is through a laparoscopy since it allows doctors to directly visualize the fallopian tubes and surrounding organs for signs of inflammation, adhesions, and pus, however it has the disadvantage of requiring general anesthesia; which can be extremely costly for many individuals and presents medical risks7.  Longitudinal data indicate that during a laparoscopic check-up after a documented episode of PID, as many as 40% of women who reported not using safe sex contraception were infertile 2-9 years later and displayed tubal adhesions due to PID8. Risk of infertility due to PID often increased with repeated or untreated episodes due to delays in seeking care; which can often be due to the lack of access to care or health insurance status. However, despite the well-established biological link between PID and infertility, recent population-based estimates remain limited; ultimately highlighting the need for updated analysis using contemporary, nationally representative data.
Socioeconomic Status, Ethnicity, & Insurance
Beyond its clinical consequences, PID also imposes a substantial economic burden on many women. In the United States, the cost of treating PID is high, with direct expenses for acute care and long-term effects were estimated at nearly $2 billion in 19989. Women, compared to men, more frequently report cost-related barriers to care and have lower average incomes, which can limit access to reproductive health services 10. This contributes to one of the reasons why many women of lower socioeconomic status may have a higher risk of undiagnosed PID and infertility due to the disease. Reports have also found that the average lifetime cost per person in America for PID is approximately $2,150 per episode and may increase significantly if further health complications occur such as hospital visit costs, procedures, or infertility treatment11. Although women may have insurance, due to limited coverage this may cause many women to pay out of pocket, which can be troublesome if they cannot afford it and causes women to avoid seeking healthcare. Additionally, it is important to note that ethnicity does not solely cause susceptibility to PID and leads to infertility, however different socioeconomic statuses (neighborhoods, healthcare access, economic stability) and health inequities contribute to affording treatment11. Many women go undiagnosed with PID not only because they are asymptomatic, but because they lack access to care or insurance coverage due to their socioeconomic status or neighborhood they reside in. 
Building on these socioeconomic patterns, poverty income ratio (PIR) directly connects to a woman’s history of PID being associated with infertility. PIR is relevant because women with fewer economic resources face greater barriers to STI screenings and PID treatment, which increases the likelihood of untreated infection and subsequent tubal damage12. Additionally, limited resources can also reduce access to infertility evaluation, ultimately lowering the chance that infertility is diagnosed and medically recorded. Evidence has reported that PIR and its relationship to infertility may vary by age, however higher PIR is associated with greater infertility prevalence among women in their mid-to late reproductive years12.  Also, if a woman faces a higher PIR rate, then she may not be able to afford insurance or alternate costs that may come after the healthcare visit for fertility treatment or PID; therefore, she may choose to avoid seeking medical attention. Overall, socioeconomic disadvantages, especially low income and gaps in affordable insurance, limits access to STI screening, PID treatment, and infertility evaluation; leading to underdiagnosis of infertility related to PID.
Access To Care 
During this study, it is important to note that the data being analyzed occurred during the COVID-19 era towards the end of collection. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual and reproductive health services were widely disrupted due to quarantine13. This nationwide lockdown resulted in reduced in-person clinic visits; routine screening was deferred, and patients faced barriers to accessing timely evaluation and treatment13. Studies have reported sharp declines in STI testing and clinic encounters during Spring 2020, with raising concerns for under diagnosis of women with chlamydia, gonorrhea, and delays in PID management14. Rates of PID diagnosis immediately declined when the pandemic began; however, rates began to increase a couple of months into it. Researchers have speculated that this could be due to the sudden changes occurring with the shut down and new restrictions on individuals seeking healthcare, therefore many women were going undiagnosed or not seeking consistent treatment for PID; however when the country began to have a stable plan on how to manage their clinics while following safety measures this allowed rates to increase again because people felt safe to seek the care they needed14. Lower encounter rates during the pandemic may be related to decreased access to healthcare services, reduced screenings for sexually transmitted infections, or changes in sexual behavior; therefore, when the quarantine lifted infertility and PID rates began to increase because individuals were returning to their normal routine14. This proves that access to care impacts women’s health immensely because without this access it can prolong the effects of PID and lead to infertility. 
Gaps 
Although the association between pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility is well documented, important gaps remain in population-level evidence. Much of the existing research relies on clinical samples or small regional cohorts, limiting generalizability to the broader U.S. population3. Few studies have used nationally representative data to quantify infertility prevalence among women with a history of PID, and many analyses are now more than a decade old. This has caused trends to be inconsistent and often outdated, ultimately making it difficult to monitor how reproductive sequelae (tubal scarring, infertility) are evolving nationally2. Additionally, prior work has not consistently evaluated how socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, and racial/ethnic inequities may influence the relationship between PID and infertility; despite there being some studies showing cost barriers, insurance gaps, and unequal access to care shaping women’s reproductive health outcomes10, 19. Because PID is frequently undiagnosed or unrecognized in community settings, estimates of its long-term reproductive consequences may be incomplete15. National datasets rarely include both self-reported PID history and infertility outcomes in the same sample, limiting prior researchers’ ability to examine these outcomes together across diverse demographic and economic groups. These gaps underscore the need for updated nationally representative analyses that assess both the magnitude and persistence of the PID–infertility association across diverse sociodemographic groups. This present study addresses this gap by using recent NHANES data (2017–2020) to provide contemporary estimates and evaluate whether socioeconomic and healthcare access factors attenuate the observed association. 
Research Question & Hypothesis	
Overall, this raises the research question: What is the association between PID history and infertility among U.S. women aged 18-49, and how do factors such as age, race, health insurance status, and socioeconomic status influence this relationship? The primary hypothesis posits that women reporting PID have greater odds of infertility (defined as ≥12 months attempting conception without pregnancy) than women without PID. The descriptive aim focuses on describing the prevalence of self-reported pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility among U.S. women aged 18–59 using NHANES 2017–2020 data, while describing differences in reproductive, socioeconomic, and healthcare access characteristics by PID history. Additionally, the inferential aim examines the association between self-reported PID and infertility among reproductive-aged women and assesses whether this association is modified by healthcare access indicators (e.g., insurance status and routine care use), accounting for reproductive and sociodemographic confounders.
 Methods
	Study Design and Participants
This was a cross-sectional analysis utilizing interview data gathered from the 2017-March 2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This period of the survey included pre-pandemic data. NHANES is a nationally representative survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess the overall health of American adults and children through mobile examination centers and in-home interviews16.  Data collection methods used in NHANES include in-home interviews with standardized physical examinations, questionnaires, and laboratory tests administered at the mobile examination centers. For this analysis, the target study population was adult women aged 18-59 years old, which is consistent with the age range for the Reproductive Health Questionnaire performed by NHANES. To be included in the current analysis, respondents were required to complete information on their PID history, infertility status (defined as trying to become pregnant for ≥ 12 months without achieving pregnancy), age, race/ethnicity, and their income-to-poverty ratio. For descriptive statistics of access to healthcare and insurance coverage, health insurance status and usual source of care were summarized as counts and unweighted percentages (with survey-weighted percentages noted where applicable).  Participants were excluded if they had missing or “refused/don’t know” responses for the exposure, outcome, or covariates. Additionally, they were also excluded if they did not meet the age range criteria or gender. After applying the inclusion criteria, the descriptive unweighted analytic sample contained 2,813 women. The fully adjusted survey-weighted models included 2,810 women, excluding three women who had additional covariates missing. 
Measurement of Exposure, Outcome, and Covariates
	During this analysis, the primary exposure was PID history, which was ascertained based on the participant’s response to the interview item asking whether a doctor or other health professional had ever told the participant she had PID. The outcome of this study was infertility, which was defined based on self-report of ever trying to conceive for ≥ 12 months without success. Covariates incorporated during this analysis were selected to reduce confounding and to reflect social and healthcare contexts relevant to fertility. Age was included (as a continuous variable in years) because the ability to conceive, STI exposure history, and the likelihood of prior PID all vary with age17; therefore, including it as a covariate allowed us to separate the effect of PID from known age-related differences in infertility risk. Race/ethnicity was included as a categorical variable (Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian, and Other/Multiracial). This variable captures population stratification and long-standing structural inequities that shape STI burden, access to timely treatment, and subsequent reproductive outcomes18. Socioeconomic position was represented by the family income-to-poverty ratio, treated primarily as a categorical variable and grouped into low (<1.0), medium (1.0-<3.0), and high (≥3.0). This measure reflects a household’s economic resources, which can shape whether an individual can afford preventive visits and medications, arrange transportation and time off work for appointments, understand and follow through on referrals, and cope with day-to-day stressors that affect health19. Healthcare coverage was assessed as a binary variable indicating current health insurance (insured vs. uninsured), recognizing that coverage facilitates screening, early treatment of pelvic infections, and referral pathways for infertility evaluation. Usual source of care was measured as a binary variable (has vs. does not have a regular place for care) because continuity and accessibility of care increase opportunities for STI testing, PID management, and timely fertility counseling20.Finally, this analysis reported whether respondents had ever sought medical care for infertility. This variable is included as contextual information about care-seeking, rather than as a confounder to help interpret differences in service use by PID. All covariates were obtained from the standardized NHANES household interview and health care utilization questionnaires along with previous literature focusing on history of PID among women and infertility. 
Statistical Analysis
	Statistical analysis was conducted utilizing SAS 9.4.  Descriptive statistics characterized the study sample overall and by history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID: yes/no). Continuous variables (age in years; income-to-poverty ratio) were summarized as means and standard deviations, while displaying stratified by PID status. Categorical variables (race/ethnicity, current health insurance coverage, usual source of care, and infertility status) were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Group differences were evaluated with chi-square tests from cross-tabulations of PID status with each categorical characteristic. Additionally, the prevalence of infertility within PID strata was estimated using survey-weighted percentages to reflect the NHANES design. 
	The association between PID and infertility was evaluated using logistic regression, treating infertility (yes/no) as the dependent variable and PID (yes/no) as the primary independent variable. Three model specifications were fit: (1) an unadjusted model including PID only; (2) an age-adjusted model; and (3) a fully adjusted model including age, race/ethnicity, categorical income- to-poverty ratio (cut points categorized as <1.0, 1.0-<3.0, ≥ 3.0), current health insurance coverage (insured vs. uninsured), and usual source of care (has vs. does not have a regular place for care). Reference categories were prespecified as: no PID, non-Hispanic White, income-to-poverty ratio 1.0- < 3.0, insured, and has a usual place for care. Model estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); two-sided α=0.05 defined statistical significance.	
Since NHANES uses a complex, multistage probability sample, survey-weighted logistic regression served as the primary analytic approach to generate nationally representative estimates. Models incorporated interview weights, strata, and primary sampling units to generate nationally representative estimates with appropriate variance estimation. To assess robustness, the fully adjusted model was re-fit using unweighted logistic regression, allowing comparison of effect estimates with and without application of survey weights. Estimates were similar across weighted and unweighted models, supporting the stability of the findings.
Results
	Sample Characteristics
	In Table 1, a total of 2,813 U.S. women aged 18-59 years were included in the descriptive analysis. Overall, 178 women (6.33%) reported a lifetime history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and 2,635 (93.67%) reported no history of PID. The sample was racially and ethnically diverse with including Non-Hispanic White 30.71% (n=864), Non-Hispanic Black 27.23% (n=766), Mexican American 13.58% (n=382), Non–Hispanic Asian 12.76% (n=359), Other Hispanic 10.59% (n=298), and Other Race 5.12% (n=144). Most respondents (82.12%) reported they had health insurance (n=2,305). Women with a history of PID were older on average than those without (42.93 ± 10.75 vs 38.47 ± 12.54 years). The mean family income-to-poverty ratio was 2.46 ± 1.66 overall and was lower among women with a history of PID compared with those without (2.01 ± 1.46 vs 2.49 ± 1.67). Access to routine care was common in the full sample with 84.03% (n=2,362) women reporting access to care, while 15.97% (n=449) did not have a usual place for care. Seeking medical help for inability to become pregnant was reported by 206 participants (7.33%). Specifically, there were 18 (10.11%) women with a history of PID who sought out medical help for the inability to become pregnant, while 188 (7.14%) with no history of PID did not seek care for infertility.

1. PID history is based on self-reported response to the question: “Has a doctor or another health professional ever told you that you had PID (pelvic inflammatory disease)”? 
2. Infertility status is defined as self-report of trying to get pregnant for ≥ 12 months without success 
3. Sample includes U.S. women aged 18-59 who completed the NHANES 2017-2020 reproductive health questionnaire.

	Association of Infertility Prevalence by PID History
	In Table 2, infertility prevalence was defined as actively trying to conceive for ≥ 12 months without pregnancy. Overall, 5.35% (n=145) of women without history of PID were infertile, while 9.88% (n=33) of women with a PID history reported infertility. Unadjusted logistic regression indicated that women with a history of PID had twice the odds of infertility compared with women without PID (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.34, 2.98). Adjustment for age yielded a very similar estimate (aOR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.89). In the fully adjusted model (including age, race/ethnicity, income-to-poverty ratio category, current health insurance status, and usual source of care), the association remained statistically significant (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.18).

Sensitivity Analysis 
To evaluate the robustness of the findings, the fully adjusted logistic regression model was re-fit using unweighted estimation and compared with the weighted survey model. Effect estimates from the unweighted model were similar in magnitude to those from the survey-weighted analysis (e.g., AOR 1.94 vs. 1.90), indicating that the association between PID and infertility was not sensitive to the application of NHANES sampling weights.
Discussion
This study aimed to examine the association between self-reported pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility among U.S. women aged 18–59 years using nationally representative NHANES data from 2017–2020 to determine if factors such as age, race, health insurance status, and socioeconomic status influence this relationship. We found that women with a history of PID had nearly twice the odds of reporting infertility compared to those without PID. Infertility prevalence was 9.88% among women with PID compared to 5.35% among women without PID. This pattern was consistent across unadjusted, age-adjusted, and fully adjusted survey-weighted logistic regression models. In the fully adjusted model, which accounted for age, race/ethnicity, income-to-poverty ratio, insurance status, and access to care, PID remained significantly associated with infertility (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.13–3.18). These findings support the study’s hypothesis that a history of PID is associated with increased odds of infertility.
Additionally, the results align with prior literature documenting the long-term reproductive consequences of PID. Previous studies have shown that untreated or recurrent PID can cause permanent tubal damage, which increases the risk of infertility through mechanisms such as scarring, inflammation, and adhesions 7. Research using laparoscopic examinations has demonstrated that even a single episode of PID can lead to tubal factor infertility years later, consistent with the elevated infertility prevalence observed in this study9. Additionally, epidemiologic studies have found that women with prior chlamydia or gonorrhea infections (two leading causes of PID) experience higher rates of tubal obstruction and subsequent infertility18. The present findings build on this evidence by offering updated, nationally representative estimates from recent NHANES cycles, including the years immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study also compare closely with results from the NHANES 2013-2016 cross-sectional analysis measuring self-reported infertility and associated pelvic inflammatory disease in women of reproductive age3. Findings reported that both infertility and PID were positively associated in a nationally representative sample. In their study, approximately 13.8% of sexually experienced women reported infertility, a prevalence somewhat higher than the 6.33% observed in our sample, likely reflecting differences in age range and analytic definitions3. However, despite these differences in baseline prevalence, the strength of association between PID and infertility in their analysis was similar to our study, reinforcing the consistency of this relationship across multiple NHANES cycles. Our study builds on this foundation by incorporating more recent data and by examining whether socioeconomic and healthcare access factors modify this association. 
The results found that the strength of association was consistent even after adjusting for socioeconomic indicators and emphasizes the biological impact of PID. Although socioeconomic disadvantage is known to limit access to STI testing, delay care, and increase risk of untreated infections; PID continued to show an independent association with infertility even after these factors were accounted for and effect estimates were very similar before and after this adjustment11. This is consistent with literature documenting that once tubal damage has occurred, socioeconomic differences play less of a role in shaping infertility risk. However, it remains important to recognize that socioeconomic barriers, including limited insurance coverage, cost-related delays in seeking care, and reduced access to routine reproductive health services contribute to missed or delayed PID diagnosis. These structural inequities help explain why PID prevalence and its complications remain disproportionately higher in certain populations, underscoring the broader public health implications of the findings. Overall, the findings highlight the continued need for timely STI screening, appropriate PID management, and improved access to reproductive healthcare.
Limitations
Like most research studies, this analysis has limitations. First, the cross-sectional design prevents determination of temporal ordering; although it is biologically plausible that PID preceded infertility, the timing of each event cannot be confirmed. Second, both PID history and infertility were self-reported, which introduces potential recall bias and misclassification. Because PID is often asymptomatic, many infections may go undiagnosed, possibly underestimating the true effect. Third, NHANES does not distinguish infertility caused by tubal factor compared to infertility due to male partners or other medical conditions. As a result, some infertility cases may not be directly attributable to PID. 
Strengths
Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths. NHANES provides high-quality, nationally representative data, enhancing generalizability to U.S. women aged 18–59. The reproductive health questionnaire uses standardized measures of infertility, which improves consistency across participants. The analysis applied survey weights to ensure nationally representative population estimates and correct variance estimation. Additionally, multiple adjusted models were used to examine the robustness of associations, and unweighted models were run for sensitivity analyses, yielding consistent results. This strengthens confidence in the observed relationship. Importantly, this study contributes to contemporary evidence during a period in which PID surveillance data have been limited, particularly in the years surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusion
Overall, this study provides evidence that women with a history of PID have significantly greater odds of infertility compared to those without PID, even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors. These findings reinforce the importance of early detection and treatment of sexually transmitted infections to prevent PID and its long-term reproductive consequences. Public health strategies that expand STI screening, improve partner treatment services, and reduce socioeconomic barriers to care may help prevent infertility stemming from untreated PID. Because contemporary U.S. population–level data linking PID and infertility remain limited, this study helps fill an important gap by providing updated, nationally representative estimates of this association15. Future research should include longitudinal studies with clinical confirmation of PID and detailed infertility etiologies to better understand causal pathways and develop targeted interventions. Clinical diagnosis of PID is still imprecise because there is no widely adopted, minimally invasive “gold standard” of detecting this disease besides laparoscopy15. This is inconvenient to many individuals seeking PID care due to the high cost because of anesthesia involvement and its invasiveness. Additionally, due to the lack of a solid diagnosis routine, the disease is frequently missed and causes women to live with the disease for many years, resulting in infertility15. Researchers and providers should focus on solidifying an affordable and early detecting diagnosis plan for women to avoid the increasing rates of PID associated with infertility. Additionally, research is needed to evaluate whether improved diagnostic tools, broader antimicrobial regimens, and more effective partner management strategies can reduce not only acute PID but also downstream infertility, particularly among women facing socioeconomic barriers to timely care15. Strengthening reproductive healthcare access and prioritizing prevention efforts may ultimately help reduce the burden of preventable infertility among U.S. women.
Lay Summary
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive organs that can cause long-term health problems, including infertility. This project used national survey data from U.S. women ages 18–59 to examine whether women who had ever been diagnosed with PID were more likely to experience infertility. Infertility was defined as trying to become pregnant for at least one year without success. The study included more than 2,800 women and compared infertility rates between those with and without a history of PID. Women who had previously been told they had PID were almost twice as likely to report infertility compared to women without PID. This pattern remained even after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, income level, health insurance, and access to regular medical care. These findings highlight the importance of early testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, which can prevent PID and reduce the risk of infertility later in life.
